# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Sound Wave Sculptor is an application that transforms audio input into three-dimensional sculptural forms. The system analyzes sound wave characteristics such as frequency, amplitude, and temporal patterns to generate unique 3D models that can be visualized, manipulated, and exported for 3D printing or digital display. This creates a bridge between auditory and visual art, allowing users to see and physically create representations of their favorite sounds, music, or audio recordings.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an artist, I want to upload an audio file and generate a 3D sculpture based on its sound waves, so that I can create physical art pieces from my favorite music or sounds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an audio file THEN the system SHALL accept common audio formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC, M4A)
2. WHEN an audio file is processed THEN the system SHALL analyze frequency spectrum, amplitude variations, and temporal patterns
3. WHEN sound analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a 3D mesh representation based on the audio characteristics
4. IF the audio file is longer than 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL allow the user to select a specific time segment for processing
5. WHEN a 3D sculpture is generated THEN the system SHALL display a real-time 3D preview with rotation and zoom capabilities

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize how sound waves are translated into 3D forms, so that I can create sculptures that match my artistic vision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the sculpture generator THEN the system SHALL provide controls for mapping frequency ranges to different sculpture dimensions (height, width, depth)
2. WHEN adjusting parameters THEN the system SHALL offer real-time preview updates of the sculpture changes
3. WHEN customizing the sculpture THEN the system SHALL allow users to set amplitude sensitivity to control the sculpture's surface detail
4. WHEN generating sculptures THEN the system SHALL provide preset mapping styles (organic, geometric, abstract, architectural)
5. IF a user creates custom settings THEN the system SHALL allow saving and loading of custom parameter profiles

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a maker, I want to export my sound-based sculptures in various formats, so that I can 3D print them or use them in other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sculpture is finalized THEN the system SHALL export models in STL format for 3D printing
2. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL provide OBJ format for use in 3D modeling software
3. WHEN preparing for 3D printing THEN the system SHALL validate model integrity and suggest fixes for non-manifold geometry
4. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL allow users to scale the model to specific dimensions
5. IF the model has thin features THEN the system SHALL warn users about potential 3D printing issues and suggest modifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a music enthusiast, I want to see real-time visualization of how my audio is being converted to 3D form, so that I can understand the relationship between sound and sculpture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audio is playing THEN the system SHALL display a synchronized waveform visualization
2. WHEN processing audio THEN the system SHALL show a frequency spectrum analyzer in real-time
3. WHEN generating the sculpture THEN the system SHALL highlight which parts of the audio correspond to which parts of the 3D model
4. WHEN audio playback occurs THEN the system SHALL animate the 3D sculpture to show how different audio segments contribute to the final form
5. IF the user pauses audio playback THEN the system SHALL freeze the visualization at the current timestamp

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to work with live audio input, so that I can create sculptures from real-time sounds like musical performances or environmental audio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting live input mode THEN the system SHALL access the device's microphone with user permission
2. WHEN recording live audio THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing current audio levels and frequency content
3. WHEN capturing live audio THEN the system SHALL allow users to set recording duration (5 seconds to 2 minutes)
4. WHEN live recording is complete THEN the system SHALL immediately process the captured audio into a 3D sculpture
5. IF audio levels are too low THEN the system SHALL warn the user and suggest adjusting input sensitivity

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to save and manage my created sculptures, so that I can build a collection and revisit previous creations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sculpture is created THEN the system SHALL allow users to save the sculpture with a custom name and description
2. WHEN saving sculptures THEN the system SHALL store both the 3D model and the original audio file reference
3. WHEN viewing saved sculptures THEN the system SHALL display a gallery with thumbnails and metadata
4. WHEN managing the collection THEN the system SHALL allow users to delete, rename, or duplicate saved sculptures
5. IF storage space is limited THEN the system SHALL notify users and provide options to free up space
